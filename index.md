- I will join Westlake University as a research scientist (副研究员), and work with Prof. [Mohamad Sawan](http://www.mohamadsawan.org/).

- I was a Post-doc Fellow at [I2Sense Lab](https://ucalgary.ca/i2sense/), [University of Calgary](https://www.ucalgary.ca/), Calgary, Canada. My supervisor is Prof. [Orly Yadid-Pecht](https://www.ucalgary.ca/i2sense/yadid_pecht_biography). Our Research focuses on image processing, especially wide dynamic range tone mapping algorithm.

- I received my B.Eng. School of Electronic Information Engineering, [Tianjin University](http://www.tju.edu.cn/english/), Tianjin, China in 2010 and PhD from State Key Laboratory for Superlattices and Microstructures  [Institute of Semiconductors](http://english.semi.cas.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.cas.cn/), Beijing, China in 2015. My PhD supervisor is Prof. [Nanjian Wu](http://lab.semi.ac.cn/yanjiusheng/contents/1323/124591.html). My PhD thesis is about vision chip design. 

- My current research interests are image processing, machine learning related VLSI design.
