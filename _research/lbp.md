###Abstract

A local binary pattern (LBP)-based tracking algorithm and a novel
heterogeneous vision chip architecture that implements the algorithm
in high speed are proposed. The algorithm is more robust than previously
reported high-speed tracking algorithms. The proposed
vision chip architecture adopts multiple levels of parallel processors
to execute the algorithm in pixel-parallel and patch-parallel ways.
Experimental results show that the proposed implementation can
achieve 1000 fps robust tracking.
